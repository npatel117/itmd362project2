# Self-Critique
This class project was gained me nice experience of working in group. We all had some skills to bring to this project. I had the syllabus page to work on. Our team had hard time figuring out the CSS behind the collapsing menu and at the end it came out really well. I wasn't that good with CSS and I learned a lot about good ideas like collapsing menu, google calendar with the abilities to sync with your phone calendar, mobile friendly interface and still able to read clearly. I also learned about javascript and to look into minor details in a website like the color contrast. 

# PROJECT TWO: REDESIGN THIS WEBSITE!

# Project Description
Some of the very worst designed websites youâ€™ll come across are for banking, credit card payment, HR portals, and other non-optional websites for certain classes of customers or workers. Self-selected teams of 3 students will redesign this website. Additionally, you will add a compelling log in page, as if this were an on-line course for sale. Your redesigned should employ sound principles of human-computer interaction, user experience, and emotional design.

# Project Goals
* Conduct a task analysis for creating a user-centered design
* Apply design principles including color/material, typography, accessible media, and grid-based design.
* Execute a progressively enhanced, touch-friendly, mobile-first responsive design focused on system users and tasks.
* Write informative text content; catch error conditions and guide users accordingly.
* Experiment with design and interaction patterns for pleasing user experience.
* Engage in agile, iterative web design and development within a team-based work-flow on GitHub, via pull requests and code reviews.

# Deliverables & Milestones
Lab 5 Whole team: Create a group or join a group on Basecamp Project 2: Group Sign Up. Groups should be 3 people each. Group names should be creative. Each group member should list their GitHub username and one team member should be chosen to initiate lab 5.

First Deliverable: Whole Team: Create a Basecamp post describing your work in progress. Title the post with your team name and project number (example: Team Wonder Women - Project 2). Your post should include the full names of all team members, and a screen-by-screen task analysis of your redesign.

Second Deliverable: Whole Team: Update your project 2 Basecamp post with the URL to your group GitHub repository, live link (GitHub pages), and two questions eliciting feedback from fellow students.
Comments: Individual: Give constructive comments to help at least three other teams.

Final Deliverable: Whole Team: Revise your team Basecamp post under Project 2 to add links to each member's individual fork of the group GitHub repository. Individual forks should include README.md files with following:
A 3-4 sentence self-critique memo of your project and your progress in class to this point.

# Git requirements:
