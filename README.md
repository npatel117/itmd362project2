# PROJECT TWO: REDESIGN THIS WEBSITE!

# Project Description
Some of the very worst designed websites you’ll come across are for banking, credit card payment, HR portals, and other non-optional websites for certain classes of customers or workers. Self-selected teams of 3 students will redesign this website. Additionally, you will add a compelling log in page, as if this were an on-line course for sale. Your redesigned should employ sound principles of human-computer interaction, user experience, and emotional design.

# Project Goals
* Conduct a task analysis for creating a user-centered design
* Apply design principles including color/material, typography, accessible media, and grid-based design.
* Execute a progressively enhanced, touch-friendly, mobile-first responsive design focused on system users and tasks.
* Write informative text content; catch error conditions and guide users accordingly.
* Experiment with design and interaction patterns for pleasing user experience.
* Engage in agile, iterative web design and development within a team-based work-flow on GitHub, via pull requests and code reviews.

# Deliverables & Milestones
Lab 5 Whole team: Create a group or join a group on Basecamp Project 2: Group Sign Up. Groups should be 3 people each. Group names should be creative. Each group member should list their GitHub username and one team member should be chosen to initiate lab 5.

First Deliverable: Whole Team: Create a Basecamp post describing your work in progress. Title the post with your team name and project number (example: Team Wonder Women - Project 2). Your post should include the full names of all team members, and a screen-by-screen task analysis of your redesign.

Second Deliverable: Whole Team: Update your project 2 Basecamp post with the URL to your group GitHub repository, live link (GitHub pages), and two questions eliciting feedback from fellow students.
Comments: Individual: Give constructive comments to help at least three other teams.

Final Deliverable:Whole Team: Revise your team Basecamp post under Project 2 to add links to each member's individual fork of the group GitHub repository. Individual forks should include README.md files with following:
A 3-4 sentence self-critique memo of your project and your progress in class to this point.

# Requirements

* Must pass HTML and CSS validators!
# HTML requirements:

* JavaScript that uses only asynchronous methods and callbacks
# Git requirements:
* Whole team: A shared team Git repository with frequent commits from each team member and meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect each set of changes.
* Each team member: An individual Git repository with feature branches, frequent commits, and meaningful commit messages that accurately reflect each set of changes that you make, including experimental work that you ultimately might not push upstream to the shared group repository.
* All GitHub repositories (team and individual) must contain only the files and commits from this project.
